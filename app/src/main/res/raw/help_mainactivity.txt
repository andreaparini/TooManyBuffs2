Hey guys, welcome to TooManyBuffs :)
TooManyBuffs is an application designed to help you in getting the numbers you need during your Pathfinder sessions.
It will help you find your to-hit roll, your damage bonus to your attacks and your armor class.
To start using the app, just tap on New Build, where you will need to insert your character information, like your character's name, class, level and statistics.
You can retrieve your saved builds from the Load/Manage Builds button. More specific help can be retrieved directly on the specific windows.
Enjoy :D
