In this window you can create a new character build, that will be saved in memory. You can specify your character's name, class and level.
You need to enter your character's strength, dexterity and constitution WITHOUT any sort of temporary modification (such as a belt of constitution). Just enter your character's base stats, modified ONLY by racial and level adjustments.
Insert your character's hit points MODIFIED by your base constitution (the one you entered above) but not by anything else.

For instance, my level 8 barbarian has a constitution score of 16, he is a dwarf (so he gets a racial +2), and i have put 2 points in constitution at levels 4 and 8. He also has a belt of might constitution +2. I must insert 20 in the constitution score. 
I must insert the hit points he has only with constitution 20. I will insert the +2 to constitution as a enhancement bonus later.
